Privacy Policy for Magic Atlas

Effective date: 2026-02-25

This Privacy Policy explains how Magic Atlas (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Magic Atlas mobile application (the “App”).

This policy applies only to the Magic Atlas app. For our website privacy policy, please visit the privacy page on our main site.

Information We Collect

1. Account Information (Firebase Authentication)
If you choose to sign in, we use Firebase Authentication to create and manage your account. Firebase may collect and store:
• Email address (if provided)
• A user identifier (UID)
• Information about your sign-in method (e.g., email/password, Apple, Google)

2. App Data (Firebase Firestore)
To provide and sync core App features across devices, we store certain app-related information in Firebase Firestore, such as:
• Credits balance
• Streak counts and last completion day
• Unlocked and learned items (e.g., techniques and tricks)
• Pro status and, if applicable, subscription expiration date

3. Guest Mode
You may use the App as a guest without creating a Firebase-backed account. In guest mode, certain features may be limited, and data may be stored only locally on your device.

4. Advertising (Google Mobile Ads / AdMob)
The App may display advertisements using Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). AdMob and its partners may collect device and usage information to display and measure ads. Depending on your region and settings, you may be asked for consent to personalized ads.

We do not directly sell your personal data.

How We Use Information
We use the information we collect to:
• Authenticate users and manage accounts
• Provide and sync core App features (e.g., progress, streaks, unlocks)
• Manage subscriptions and entitlements (Pro status)
• Display and measure advertising (if applicable)
• Maintain, secure, and improve the App
• Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms

Sharing of Information
We share information with service providers solely to operate and improve the App:
• Firebase (Auth, Firestore) by Google — for authentication and cloud data storage
• Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) — for advertising

We do not sell your personal information.

Data Retention and Deletion
We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the App. You may request deletion of your account and associated data by emailing support@mind-mirage.uk from the email address associated with your account and including your request to delete your Magic Atlas account. After we verify your request, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable timeframe, subject to legal obligations.

If you use guest mode, your data may be stored locally on your device. Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data.

Children’s Privacy
Magic Atlas is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). If you believe we have collected personal information from a child, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

International Data Transfers
Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your own. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for such transfers.

Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy with a revised effective date.
